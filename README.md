# Personal-Portfolio-Website
I developed a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS to showcase my projects, skills, and experience. The website features a clean, responsive design, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across devices. Key sections include an About Me page, Project Gallery with descriptions and links, a Skills section highlighting technical proficiencies, and a Contact form for inquiries. Custom CSS animations enhance visual appeal, while organized, semantic HTML ensures accessibility and SEO-friendliness. This project demonstrates my front-end development skills and attention to detail, providing a professional platform to present my work and connect with potential employers or collaborators.
